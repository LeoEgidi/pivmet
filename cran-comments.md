## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Package pivmet was removed from 
the CRAN repository on January 24th, since check issues 
reported by professor Brian D. Ripley on December 29th were
not corrected in time. In this version I fixed the issues
and I have:

* suppressed vignettes with duplicates titles (index 
entries) 

## Test environments
* win-builder (devel and release)
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* local Linux, R 3.5.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

  
## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

Thank you
