## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Package pivmet was removed from 
the CRAN repository on January 24th, since check issues 
reported by professor Brian D. Ripley on December 29th were
not corrected in time. In this version I fixed the issues
and I have:

* changed the title in the %\VignetteIndexEntry lines in the vignette sources. Now  they correspond to the vignette title.

* included rmarkdown in the Suggests field in the description.

* fixed the version number and the date field

## Test environments
* win-builder (devel and release)
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* local Linux, R 3.5.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

  
## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

Thank you
