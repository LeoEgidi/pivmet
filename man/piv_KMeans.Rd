\usage{
piv_KMeans(x, centers, alg.type = "KMeans", method = "average",
  piv.criterion = c("MUS", "maxsumint", "minsumnoint", "maxsumdiff"),
  H = 1000, iter.max = 10, num.seeds = 10, prec_par = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \eqn{N \times D} data matrix, or an object that can be coerced to such a matrix (such as a numeric vector or a dataframe with all numeric columns).}

\item{centers}{The number of groups for the the \eqn{k}-means solution.}

\item{alg.type}{The clustering algorithm for the initial partition of the
\eqn{N} units into the desired number of clusters.
Possible choices are \code{"KMeans"} (default) and \code{"hclust"}.}

\item{method}{If \code{alg.type} is \code{"hclust"}, the character string
defining the clustering method. The methods implemented are  \code{"single"},
\code{"complete"}, \code{"average"}, \code{"ward.D"}, \code{"ward.D2"}, \code{"mcquitty"},
\code{"median"}, \code{"centroid"}. The default is \code{"average"}.}

\item{piv.criterion}{The pivotal criterion used for identifying one pivot
for each group. Possible choices are: \code{"MUS", "maxsumint", "minsumnoint",
"maxsumdiff"}.
If \code{centers <= 4}, the default method is \code{"MUS"};
otherwise, the default method is \code{"maxsumint"} (see the details and
the vignette).}

\item{H}{The number of distinct \eqn{k}-means runs used for building the \eqn{N \times N} co-association matrix. Default is 10^3.}

\item{iter.max}{If \code{alg.type} is \code{"KMeans"}, the maximum number of iterations to be passed to \code{KMeans()}. Default is 10.}

\item{num.seeds}{If \code{alg.type} is \code{"KMeans"}, the number of different starting random seeds to be passed to \code{KMeans()}. Default is 10.}

\item{prec_par}{If \code{piv.criterion} is \code{"MUS"}, the maximum number of competing pivots in each group. If groups' sizes are less than the default value, which is 10,
then it is set equal to the cardinality of the smallest group in the initial partition.}
}
\value{
A list with components

\item{\code{cluster}}{A vector of integers indicating the cluster to which each point is allocated.}
\item{\code{centers}}{A matrix of cluster centers (centroids).}
\item{\code{coass}}{The co-association matrix built from ensemble clustering.}
\item{\code{pivots}}{The pivotal units identified by the selected pivotal criterion.}
\item{\code{totss}}{The total sum of squares.}
\item{\code{withinss}}{The within-cluster sum of squares for each cluster.}
\item{\code{tot.withinss}}{The within-cluster sum of squares summed across clusters.}
\item{\code{betwennss}}{The between-cluster sum of squared distances.}
\item{\code{size}}{ The number of points in each cluster.}
\item{\code{iter}}{The number of (outer) iterations.}
\item{\code{ifault}}{integer: indicator of a possible algorithm problem (for experts).}

\description{
Perform classical k-means clustering on a data matrix using pivots as
initial centers.
}
\details{
The function implements a modified version of k-means which aims at
improving the clustering solution starting from a careful seeding.
In particular, it performs a pivot-based initialization step
using pivotal methods to find the initial centers
for the clustering procedure. The starting point consists of multiple
runs of the classical k-means (which uses random seeds via \code{Kmeans}
function of the \code{RcmdrMisc} package)
with a fixed number of clusters
in order to build the co-association matrix of data units.
